# Project: Faasen Trading
# Context: South African Supply Chain Brokerage (B2B)

## Business Logic (The "Golden Rules")
1.  **The Middleman Rule:** We are a blind broker.
    - Buyers NEVER see Supplier names/contacts.
    - Suppliers NEVER see Buyer names/contacts.
    - Faasen Trading is the counter-party to everyone.
2.  **The Profit Model:**
    - `Client_Price` = `Supplier_Price` + `Faasen_Margin` + `Logistics_Cost`.
    - We profit on the spread.
3.  **Local Context:**
    - Currency: ZAR (South African Rand).
    - Tax: All calculations must handle SA VAT (15%) separately.
    - Logistics: We hire third-party transporters.
